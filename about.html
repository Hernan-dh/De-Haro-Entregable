            <p></br>Hey there! Welcome to our corner of the gaming universe. We’re an indie game studio from Argentina, driven by a passion for creating games that are as fun to play as they are for us to make.
            </br>
            </br>
            Our journey started back in 2009 when a group of friends, fueled by nothing but a love for games and a dream, decided to create something special right here in our hometown. 
            </br>
            </br>
            With a couple of old PCs and endless cups of mate, we launched our first big adventure: CapyDash Canyon in 2012, a 3D platformer that had players bouncing, sliding, and dashing through a vibrant, chaotic world. That was the moment we knew we were onto something.
            </br>
            </br>
            Next up, in 2014, we dove into the world of Metroidvania with Capybara Forest. Watching players explore every nook and cranny of the mysterious forest we designed was an unforgettable experience for us.
            </br>
            </br>
            Then came CapyKart Racers in 2016, where we embraced our love for speed with a wild, colorful kart racing game. Drifting, boosting, and crashing our way into players’ hearts, it was all about pure, unfiltered fun.
            </br>
            </br>
            In 2019, we took a darker turn with Capybara of Shadows, a Soulslike that challenged even the toughest gamers. We reveled in the joy (and frustration) it brought to those brave enough to take it on.
            </br>
            </br>
            But we didn’t stop there. In 2021, we unleashed CapyBrawl Arena, a hero shooter where teamwork and chaos ruled the day. It was a blast to create, and even more fun to watch players dive into the fray.
            </br>
            </br>
            Finally, in 2023, we slowed things down with Capybara Crossing, a cozy social sim that let players build their dream village and escape into a world of tranquility and friendship.
            </br>
            </br>
            So that’s our story so far—a bunch of passionate gamers who turned a dream into reality. We’ve come a long way since 2009, but our mission stays the same: to create games that surprise, challenge, and, most importantly, bring joy. Thanks for being part of our journey, and keep an eye out—there’s always something new on the horizon!</p>
